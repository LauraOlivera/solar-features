# solar-features
Detection of features (filaments and prominences) in H-alpha solar images.

- solar_features.py : main functions
- solar_feat_ex.py : example script
- detecting_prominences.ipynb, detecting_filaments.ipynb, time_evolution.ipynb: detailed steps and incredibly messy code -> look at own risk
